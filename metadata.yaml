description: |
  Fail2ban monitors log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,
  /var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily or persistently bans
  failure-prone addresses by updating existing firewall rules.  Fail2ban
  allows easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to
  ban an IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a
  notification email.  By default, it comes with filter expressions for
  various services (sshd, apache, qmail, proftpd, sasl etc.) but
  configuration can be easily extended for monitoring any other text
  file.  All filters and actions are given in the config files, thus
  fail2ban can be adopted to be used with a variety of files and
  firewalls.
